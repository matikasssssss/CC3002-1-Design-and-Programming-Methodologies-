/**
 * `CommonPotion` is a trait that extends the `AbstractPotions` class.
 * It serves as a base for all common potions, inheriting the properties and methods from `AbstractPotions`.
 * The `CommonPotion` trait does not define any additional behavior or properties on its own but can be used
 * as a marker for common potions that share common characteristics.
 *
 * @see AbstractPotions for the base implementation of potions.
