/**
 * `MagicPotion` is a trait that extends the `AbstractPotions` class.
 * It serves as a base for all magical potions in the game, inheriting the basic properties and methods of potions.
 * The `MagicPotion` trait does not define any additional behavior or properties on its own but can be used
 * as a marker for potions that provide magical effects.
 *
 * @see AbstractPotions for the base implementation of potions.
